* PHP projects need scip-php installed and `composer install` done. Functions and constants brought in with `use function` and `use const` are no longer dependencies. Violations name the target file rather than the specifier as written.

* Go and TypeScript projects need scip-go and scip-typescript installed (and node_modules for TypeScript). Only files a tsconfig.json includes are checked. require() in .ts files, vi.mock() and similar string arguments are no longer imports, and a violation names the target file rather than the specifier as written.
